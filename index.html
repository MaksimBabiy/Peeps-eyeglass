              <p itemprop="reviewBody">So I have these all over my house, and one in my car as I always seem to get my glasses dirty. These have been better for keeping the smudges at bay more-so than the fabric cloth as i have giant hands and always seem to make things worse. Well the pads on my peeps in the car got messed up/bent, likely due to significant heat over the summer, and I was going to just order another set, but my wife said, "WAIT, you can replace the pads!" So you get two sets of pads in the replacement case for the price of what you pay for a set of peeps. I'd say it's worth it for that, also happy that i didn't end up having to purchase a new one and this gives me a replacement set for when i need to replace another one. So overall, happy with these!</p>

              <p itemprop="reviewBody">It is early days, but so far I am loving my peeps. My glasses are much cleaner than with the liquid and done much more easily and efficiently. I love the addition of the brush in order to prevent scratching the lens prior to cleaning. Edit: I also love that they fit easily into an already crowded handbag and while I usually only purchase everything in black, my favorite color, I thought the bright pink would be easily found, wherever I might misplace it. I am looking forward to purchasing a second one to leave at home.</p>

              <p itemprop="reviewBody">If you wear glasses and are frustrated with the towel & spray cleaning then get this gem. It’s super fast and convenient! I have several of them. I keep one in my truck, work bag and one at home. They are small enough to carry but I just leave one in every spot that I frequent for easy access. I’ll never use the towel & spray again. I think the company could even make a smaller model for even greater portability which would be even better but I’m still very pleased with it. It’s a must buy!</p>
